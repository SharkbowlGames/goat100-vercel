1. Contabo plan

- but new vps server or dedicated vps server
https://contabo.com/en/dedicated-servers/
or
https://contabo.com/en/vds/ (best?)

or
https://contabo.com/en/vps/ (26.99) is current (xxl)

Then, asl Contabo (pay) to transfer server snapshot from current to new server.

2. buy WP hosting... for app does not matter will be some ip or predefinid url... it matters for staff.

WHY

Because if WP is on same server(url) - no cahe...
If is on other server... then we can set cache as we want and even better connect WP to cdn

I am 1000% sure this will raise performance very seriously.

this is beggining
